### Setup

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies. Run `flask run` to run Flask app.

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) if you haven't already. In the `frontend` directory, run `yarn install` to install node modules, then `yarn build` to set up React app. You have to re-run `yarn build` if you change the assets in the repo, e.g. new image files.

The frontend can be run with hot reloading by running `yarn start` in the `frontend` directory.
